<div class="collapse" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion" id="collapse1">
<div class="accordion-body">

<p style="text-align:justify;">To complete a FMC consultation, all you need to do is answer our quick online medical intake questionnaire, and verify your identity by uploading a photo ID, such as a valid drivers license or state ID. Your answers are then reviewed by our medical team, who will notify you during your initial telehealth (audio-visual) appointment whether you are eligible for treatment, and which GLP-1 weight loss medication will work best for you.</p>

<div class="accordion-item"><a class="accordion_btn collapsed" data-bs-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse2">Is GLP-1 medication FDA approved?</a>

<div class="collapse" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion" id="collapse2">
<div class="accordion-body">
<p style="text-align:justify;">Semaglutide and Tirzepatide are FDA-Approved active ingredients used in Ozempic®, Wegovy®, Mounjaro® and Zepbound®, that have helped thousands of people lose and maintain weight loss.<br />
<br />
Medically approved patients are typically prescriped Semaglutide or Tirzepatide injections, which are slowly absorbed by the body over a week&#39;s duration, to help curb your appetite and reduce cravings.<br /> 
<br />
The Semaglutide or Tirzepatide GLP-1 medication you may be prescribed is a generic compounded medication and is not associated with the pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk&trade; or Eli Lilly&trade;, or the brand-name medications Ozempic®, Wegovy®, Mounjaro® and Zepbound®.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="accordion-item"><a class="accordion_btn collapsed" data-bs-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse3">How do GLP-1 medications make you lose weight?</a>

<div class="collapse" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion" id="collapse3">
<div class="accordion-body">
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ozempic® & Wegovy® (Semaglutide) function by regulating food intake and appetite as a human GLP-1 receptor agonist, which is a synthetic analog of the naturally occurring hormone GLP-1 in the body. By targeting specific areas in the brain responsible for appetite regulation, it suppresses your appetite, controls cravings, and signals you to feel full. 
Furthermore, it slows down the rate at which the stomach empties, leading to a prolonged sensation of fullness.<br /><br />
Mounjaro® & Zepbound® (Tirzepatide) work differently than other drugs in the GLP-1 family, as they contain an extra molecule that may give them a slight edge. These medications have a dual-action design, mimicking the action of not one but two incretin hormones that affect appetite and satiety: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). This unique dual action makes Tirzepatide the first-in-class medicine that acts on both of these receptors.<br /><br />
When used in conjunction with diet and exercise, GLP-1 medication can cause significant weight loss, reduce risks of cancer, diabetes and heart disease in people who are obese or overweight.</p>

<div class="accordion-item"><a class="accordion_btn collapsed" data-bs-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse4">Is your weight loss program confidential?</a>

<div class="collapse" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion" id="collapse4">
<div class="accordion-body">
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yes. Your medical data and order history can only be viewed by our medical team and prescribers. You can view our Privacy Policy for more information.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="accordion-item"><a class="accordion_btn collapsed" data-bs-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse5">Do I need a prescription?</a>

<div class="collapse" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion" id="collapse5">
<div class="accordion-body">
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you are deemed eligible for treatment, our medical team will issue you a prescription for either Semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic® & Wegovy® or Tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Mounjaro® & Zepbound®. You don&#39;t need an existing prescription to join the FMC weight loss program.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class="accordion-item"><a class="accordion_btn collapsed" data-bs-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse6">Is your weight loss program covered by health insurance?</a>

<div class="collapse" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion" id="collapse6">
<div class="accordion-body">
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our weight loss subscription program is not eligible for coverage through health insurance providers. This means that individuals who choose to enroll will need to cover the costs themselves. 
Payment for the different subscription plans can be made via ACH transfer, credit or debit card. These flexible payment options allow customers to choose the method that suits them best, ensuring a convenient and accessible way to invest in their health and wellness journey.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="accordion-item"><a class="accordion_btn collapsed" data-bs-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse7">How much do your weight loss subscription plans cost?</a>

<div class="collapse" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion" id="collapse7">
<div class="accordion-body">
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our comprehensive weight loss subscription plans were designed to help you achieve your health and wellness goals in a sustainable and affordable way. We understand that every individual's weight loss journey is unique, which is why we offer a range of subscription options to cater to your specific needs and preferences.<br /><br />

Our subscription plans vary in price based on the length of commitment you choose. Whether you opt for a month-to-month plan or decide to commit to a longer duration, we have a plan that fits your lifestyle and budget. With our flexible pricing structure, you have the freedom to select the plan that aligns with your goals and financial considerations.<br /><br />

Health insurance companies are unlikely to cover the cost of Ozempic®, Wegovy®, Mounjaro® or Zepbound® since these medications are indicated for treating diabetes, not weight loss on its own. One of the standout benefits of our subscription plans is the remarkable cost savings they provide compared to purchasing GLP-1 weight loss medications directly from your local pharmacy. For instance, the average cost of a one-month supply of Mounjaro® or Zepbound®  at your neighborhood pharmacy is approximately $1,500. Similarly, Ozempic® or Wegovy® costs around $1,300 for a one-month supply.<br /><br />

However, by subscribing to any of our carefully curated weight loss plans, you can receive GLP-1 weight loss medications with the same active ingredients as Ozempic®, Wegovy®, Mounjaro® and Zepbound® at a significantly lower cost, allowing you to save substantial amounts of money while prioritizing your health.<br /><br />

Our mission is to make effective weight loss solutions accessible and affordable for everyone. By subscribing to one of our weight loss plans, not only do you receive high-quality medications, but you also gain access to a comprehensive support system that includes personalized guidance, nutritional advice, fitness tips, and progress tracking tools.<br /><br />

With our subscription plans, achieving your weight loss goals has never been more convenient, cost-effective, and rewarding. Embark on your transformative journey towards a healthier you with our range of weight loss subscription plans today.<br /><br />

<div class="collapse" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion" id="collapse10">
<div class="accordion-body">
<p style="text-align:justify;">A monthly follow up telehealth appointment is necessary, to discuss with your clinician how your weight loss is progressing.

<div class="collapse" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion" id="collapse12">
<div class="accordion-body">
<p style="text-align:justify;">Notify your provider immediately if you notice a lump or swelling in your neck, hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, or shortness of breath. These could be symptoms of thyroid cancer. Semaglutide or Tirzepatide is contraindicated if you or any of your family members have ever had medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), or if you suffer from an endocrine system condition called Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2). The safety and efficacy of combining Semaglutide or Tirzepatide with other weight loss products have not been established. Sharing your complete medical history with your provider is crucial. Specifically, inform your provider if you have a history of: Type 1 or type 2 diabetes, Thyroid cancer, Pancreatitis, Kidney disease, and or Diabetic retinopathy.</p>

<strong>10. REFUND POLICY<br />
<br />
Initial Consultation Fee:</strong>&nbsp;A member that has fully set up their account (including by submitting the medical history questionnaire and proper government-issued identification for verification and scheduling a clinician consultation), can receive a refund for 100% of their initial consultation fee by canceling their appointment prior to the start of the consultation or scheduled start of the consultation, whichever comes first. The start of the consultation is defined as the first communication via video or chat message from the clinician to the member. The scheduled start of the consultation is defined as the time selected by the member to meet with a clinician. Once the initial consultation starts or is scheduled to start, members are not eligible for a refund for the initial consultation fee.<br /> 
<br />
Members are not eligible for a refund if they fail to join the consultation via video or chat at the scheduled start of the consultation. In some states, a synchronous consultation is required. This meaning the member must be present on a secure video call with the clinician. If the member has technical issues that make them unable to join their scheduled appointment, the appointment will be canceled. The member is responsible for rescheduling. In the event the consultation is not rescheduled, no refund is due to the customer. If the member fails to schedule and join their initial consultation within one month of agreeing to our terms and conditions, their opportunity for a refund will be terminated.<br /> 
<br />
We review each medical history submission for any discrepancies and/or falsification of data and have the right to decline or end membership at any time if any of the provided information appears to be falsified. No refund(s) will be due to members who falsify information.<br /> 
<br />
FMC does not accept government insurance or work with government insurance companies at this time.<br />
<br />
Members must be between the ages of 18-69 to join FMC.&nbsp;Members are required to complete a telehealth visit when requesting refills.&nbsp;FMC reserves the right to change policies surrounding multi-month prescriptions at any time.<br />
<br />
<strong>Subscription Fee:&nbsp;</strong>The FMC subscription fee is not refundable once a billing period has started. If a member cancels during a billing period, they may access the FMC&nbsp;weight loss program until the end of the billing period. Members may reach out to their Care Team at any point to see when their current billing period ends, and their next billing period begins.<br />
<br />
<strong>How to Cancel:</strong>&nbsp;Members are able to cancel their initial consultation and subscription on the membership section of their account tab. For any questions, members can reach out to their Care Team within the FMC messaging portal.<br />
&zwj;<br />

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Telehealth Consent</strong></h1>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">Date of Last Revision: June 1st, 2023</p>
&nbsp;

<p style="text-align: justify;">FMC Weight Loss, (&ldquo;<strong>FMC</strong>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<strong>we</strong>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<strong>us</strong>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;<strong>our</strong>&rdquo;) provides telehealth services that allow you (&ldquo;<strong>you</strong>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<strong>your</strong>&rdquo;) to have an online consultation with a licensed health care professional (a &ldquo;<strong>Provider</strong>&rdquo;) for the purpose of obtaining any prescribed medications (collectively, the &ldquo;<strong>Services</strong>&rdquo;).</p>
&nbsp;

<p style="text-align: justify;">These Services constitute a form of telehealth, meaning health care is delivered through secure electronic communications between you and a Provider when you are not in the same physical location.</p>
&nbsp;
<br>
<b>Scope of Telehealth Services:</b><br><br>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Telehealth may be used for diagnosis, treatment, follow-up care, and/or patient education. This may include, but is not limited to:</p><br />

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&bull;</strong> Secure electronic transmission of medical records, images, personal health information, or other data between you and a Provider.</p><br />
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&bull;</strong> Real-time or asynchronous communication via video, audio, secure messaging, or email.</p><br />
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&bull;</strong> Use of data from remote monitoring devices, medical equipment, and audio/video files.</p><br />
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&bull;</strong> FMC uses websites, mobile applications, and information systems that incorporate network and software security protocols to protect the privacy, integrity, and confidentiality of your health information in compliance with HIPAA and applicable laws.</p><br />

<b>Potential Benefits:</b><br><br>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&bull;</strong> Increased access to medical care regardless of location.</p><br />
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&bull;</strong> Greater convenience and reduced travel requirements.</p><br />
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&bull;</strong> Ability to interact with Providers without the need for an in-office appointment.</p><br />

<b>Potential Limitations:</b><br><br>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&bull;</strong> Information provided may be insufficient for complete medical decision-making.</p><br />
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&bull;</strong> Certain conditions may require in-person evaluation or testing.</p><br />
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&bull;</strong> Some diagnostics (e.g., physical exams, lab testing) may be unavailable remotely.</p><br />
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&bull;</strong> Technical issues may cause delays, interruptions, or loss of data.</p><br />
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&bull;</strong> Data security safeguards, while robust, may fail.</p><br />
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&bull;</strong> Certain prescriptions or treatments may be restricted under state or federal law.</p><br />

<b>Acknowledgments and Informed Consent:</b><br><br>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By accepting this Telehealth Consent, you acknowledge and agree that:</p><br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">1. You have read and understand the risks and benefits of receiving care through telehealth.</p><br />
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. You voluntarily consent to receive medical care via telehealth from FMC Providers.</p><br />
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. You understand telehealth is an evolving field and may involve new technologies not specifically described in this consent.</p><br />
<p style="text-align: justify;">4. No specific results or outcomes are guaranteed.</p><br />
<p style="text-align: justify;">5. You will provide complete and accurate health information and promptly update your Provider about any changes.</p><br />
<p style="text-align: justify;">6. Providing false or incomplete information could result in serious harm or death.</p><br />
<p style="text-align: justify;">7. Your Provider may determine, at their sole discretion, that your condition is not appropriate for telehealth and may recommend in-person care.</p><br />
<p style="text-align: justify;">8. Telehealth does not replace your existing relationship with other health care providers.</p><br />
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>9. You cannot use the Services for emergency care. If you are experiencing a medical emergency, call 9-1-1 or seek immediate in-person care.</strong></p><br />
<p style="text-align: justify;">10. Your health information will be collected, used, and disclosed in accordance with FMC’s Privacy Policy and applicable laws.</p><br />
<p style="text-align: justify;">11. You have the right to access your telehealth records and request that FMC share your records with other providers, with your written consent.</p><br />
<p style="text-align: justify;">12. Technical failures may result in delays or loss of information, and you agree to hold FMC harmless for such occurrences.</p><br />
<p style="text-align: justify;">13. You may withdraw this consent at any time by emailing <a href="mailto:help@fmcweightloss.md">help@fmcweightloss.md</a>. This consent otherwise renews with each telehealth visit.</p><br />
<p style="text-align: justify;">14. FMC and its Providers may use and share your health information for treatment, payment, health care operations, and other purposes permitted by law.</p><br />

<b>State-Specific Disclosures:</b><br><br>
