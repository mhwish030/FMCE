Semaglutide or Tirzepatide is contraindicated if you or any of your family members have ever had medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), or if you suffer from an endocrine system condition called Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2).
The safety and efficacy of combining Semaglutide or Tirzepatide with other weight loss products have not been established.
Sharing your complete medical history with your provider is crucial. Specifically, inform your provider if you have a history of:
Type 1 or type 2 diabetes, Thyroid cancer, Pancreatitis, Kidney disease, and or Diabetic retinopathy.</p>

<br />
<strong>10. REFUND POLICY<br />
<br />
Initial Consultation Fee:</strong>&nbsp;After a member has fully set up their account (including by submitting the medical history questionnaire and proper government-issued identification for verification and scheduling a Clinician consultation), they can receive a refund for 100% of their initial consultation fee by canceling their appointment prior to the start of the consultation or scheduled start of the consultation, whichever comes first. The start of the consultation is defined as the first communication via video or chat message from the clinician to the member. The scheduled start of the consultation is defined as the time selected by the member to meet with a Clinician. Once the initial consultation starts or is scheduled to start, members are not eligible for a refund for the initial consultation fee. Members are not eligible for a refund if they fail to join the consultation via video or chat at the scheduled start of the consultation. In some states, a synchronous consultation is required. This meaning the member must be present on a secure video call with the clinician. If the member has technical issues that make them unable to join their scheduled appointment, the appointment will be canceled. The member is responsible for rescheduling. In the event the consultation is not rescheduled, no refund is due to the customer. For some members, lab work is required prior to their initial consultation. Members can get the lab work from their primary care physician or our third-party vendor. If labs are not provided or the member is unable to get their labs completed with third party vendor, the member is not eligible for a refund. If the member fails to schedule and join their initial consultation within three months of agreeing to our terms and conditions their opportunity for a refund will be terminated. To ensure members receive appropriate medical care and evaluations, a member&#39;s weight needs to be validated. This is done by submitting an image(s) of the member on a scale showing their weight. We review each submission for any discrepancy and/or falsification of data and have the right to decline or end membership at any time if the image(s) appear to be falsified. No refund(s) will be due to members who falsify information. Sequence does not accept government insurance or work with government insurance companies at this time.&nbsp;Members must be between the ages of 18-69 to join Sequence.&nbsp;Members are required to complete a series of questions when requesting refills.&nbsp;Sequence reserves the right to change policies surrounding multi-month prescriptions at any time.<br />
<br />
<strong>Subscription Fee:&nbsp;</strong>The Sequence subscription fee is not refundable once a billing period has started. If a member cancels during a billing period, they may access the Sequence program until the end of the billing period. Members may reach out to their Care Team at any point to see when their current billing period ends, and their next billing period begins.<br />
<br />
<strong>How to Cancel:</strong>&nbsp;Members are able to cancel their initial consultation and subscription on the Membership section of their Account tab. If they have any questions, members can reach out to their Care Team within the Sequence Messages portal.<br />
&zwj;<br />
<strong>How to Reschedule:</strong>&nbsp;Members must reschedule their initial consultation and subscription by reaching out to their Care Team within the Sequence message portal or by selecting the reschedule option prior to the start of their initial consultation.<br />
